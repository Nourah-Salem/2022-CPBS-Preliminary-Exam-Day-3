# Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Clustering of Metagenomic Sequences


> The objective of this project is to develop a general computational method for characterizing the viral communities in a metagenomic sample inhabiting a certain environment. Our aim is to computationally be able to classify metagenomic DNA sequences into their family groups accurately through finding the optimum size of K-mers to help us calculate the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for the normalized frequencies of the K-mers. for mode details, please check the report project.
